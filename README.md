# TransportHealthR

# Hi there
`TransportHealthR` is an R package developed by Core Clinical Sciences to streamline transportability analyses for randomized clinical trials and observational studies. The package supports IP weighting for mergable individual patient data (IPD), G-computation for unmergable IPD and (aggregate data approach) for aggregate data.

## Perks of package

Transportability analysis is often done in separate steps by a statistician. One can perform such an analysis using existing causal inference packages, but some care is needed in order to ensure a valid analysis. `TransportHealthR` makes this process more accessible to statisticians and clinicians, as the model-fitting functions in the package inherently accomodate transportability analyses.

## Get started (WIP)

Use the `R` command `devtools::install_github("CoreClinicalSciences/TransportHealthR")` in the console.

## Get help (WIP)

Contact quang\@coreclinicalsciences.com if you have any questions about the package.

## Contribute (WIP)

Feel free to create issues in the package's Github repo. We'll address them as soon as we can.
